# Production-grade AI Agents with LangChain.js, LangGraph.js, RAG, Next.js, LangSmith & Real JS/TS Projects

Most LangChain and LangGraph courses are Python-first.  
This one is built from the ground up for **JavaScript & TypeScript engineers** who want **real, shippable agentic systems** — not disconnected demos.

---

## 🚀 Why This Course?

- **JS/TS-first approach**: Everything is designed for Node.js and modern frontend frameworks.
- **Production-grade focus**: Learn how to build agents that can actually ship, not just toy examples.
- **Full-stack integration**: Combine AI pipelines with **Next.js** for real-world applications.
- **Observability & debugging**: Use **LangSmith** to monitor, trace, and improve your agents.
- **Cutting-edge orchestration**: Explore **LangGraph.js** for multi-agent workflows and control flows.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Implement scalable knowledge retrieval pipelines with vector databases.

---

## 📚 What You'll Learn

- **LangChain.js fundamentals**: Chains, tools, memory, and agents in JavaScript.
- **LangGraph.js orchestration**: Build complex agent workflows with graph-based execution.
- **RAG pipelines**: Connect embeddings, vector stores, and retrievers for knowledge-grounded responses.
- **Next.js integration**: Deploy AI agents into production-ready web apps.
- **LangSmith observability**: Debug, monitor, and optimize your agentic systems.
- **Best practices**: Error handling, scalability, and deployment strategies for JS/TS projects.

---

## 🛠️ Real Projects You'll Build

- **Customer Support Agent**: Multi-turn conversational assistant with context memory.
- **Knowledge Base Search**: RAG-powered Q&A system with embeddings and vector stores.
- **Multi-Agent Workflow**: LangGraph.js orchestrated agents collaborating on tasks.
- **Next.js AI Dashboard**: Frontend interface for monitoring and interacting with agents.
- **LangSmith Tracing Demo**: Observability setup for debugging and improving agent performance.
