# **24. Tool Calling Lifecycle (Short)**

> Tool calling is the process where an LLM **decides, invokes, and uses external tools** to complete a task.

## **Tool Calling Lifecycle (Step-by-Step)**

1️⃣ **User Input**
User asks a question or gives a task.

2️⃣ **Intent Understanding**
LLM analyzes whether it can answer directly or needs a tool.

3️⃣ **Tool Selection**
LLM selects the appropriate tool based on intent.

4️⃣ **Tool Invocation (JSON)**
LLM outputs structured JSON with:

* Tool name
* Arguments

5️⃣ **Tool Execution**
System executes the tool (API, DB, code).

6️⃣ **Observation Returned**
Tool result is sent back to the LLM.

7️⃣ **Final Response**
LLM uses observation to produce final answer.

## **Lifecycle Flow (One Line ⭐)**

```
Input → Decide → Call Tool → Observe → Respond
```

## **Why This Lifecycle Matters**

* Prevents hallucinations
* Enables real-world actions
* Makes agents reliable
* Supports multi-step workflows

---

## **Common Failure Points (Exam ⭐)**

* Tool not called when needed
* Wrong arguments passed
* Hallucinated tool output
* JSON format errors

---

## **One-Line Exam Answer**

> Tool calling lifecycle defines how an LLM decides to use a tool, executes it, observes the result, and generates the final response.
