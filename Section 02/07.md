# 07: What is an AI Agent?

This section explains the **core concept of an AI Agent** in a simple, exam-friendly and real‑world applicable way.

---

## 1. Definition of an AI Agent

An **AI Agent** is a software system that can:

* **Perceive** its environment
* **Reason** about a task
* **Decide** what action to take
* **Act** using tools or APIs
* **Learn or adapt** from outcomes (optional)

📌 **Simple definition:**

> An AI agent is an intelligent system that can make decisions and take actions to achieve a goal.

---

## 2. Why AI Agents Are Needed

Traditional AI systems:

* Only generate text
* Follow fixed instructions
* Cannot act independently

AI Agents solve this by:

* Making decisions dynamically
* Using external tools
* Executing multi-step tasks

---

## 3. Core Characteristics of an AI Agent

An AI Agent has the following properties:

### 1. Autonomy

* Works without constant human input
* Decides next steps on its own

### 2. Reasoning Ability

* Thinks before acting
* Breaks complex problems into steps

### 3. Tool Usage

* Can call APIs, databases, or services
* Interacts with the real world

### 4. Goal-Oriented Behavior

* Focused on achieving a specific objective

### 5. Feedback Awareness

* Observes results
* Adjusts actions if needed

## 4. AI Agent vs Normal AI Model

| Normal AI Model       | AI Agent             |
| --------------------- | -------------------- |
| Only generates output | Decides + acts       |
| Single-step response  | Multi-step execution |
| No tool usage         | Uses tools & APIs    |
| No memory             | Can use memory       |

## 5. How an AI Agent Works (Conceptual Flow)

```
Goal / Task
   ↓
Agent Thinks (Reasoning)
   ↓
Decides Action
   ↓
Uses Tool / API
   ↓
Observes Result
   ↓
Repeats until goal is achieved
```

This loop is called the **Agent Loop**.

---

## 6. Agent Loop: Think → Act → Observe

1. **Think** – Analyze the task and plan
2. **Act** – Call a tool or perform an action
3. **Observe** – Check the result
4. **Repeat** – Continue until task completion

📌 This makes agents **dynamic and intelligent**.

---

## 7. Real-World Examples of AI Agents

### Example 1: Customer Support Agent

* Understands user query
* Searches knowledge base
* Responds or escalates issue

### Example 2: Travel Planning Agent

* Finds flights
* Compares prices
* Books tickets

### Example 3: Coding Agent

* Writes code
* Runs tests
* Fixes errors

---

## 8. AI Agents in LangChain Context

In LangChain:

* Agents use **LLMs for reasoning**
* Tools for actions
* Memory for context
* Flow for control

📌 **LangChain Agent = LLM + Tools + Reasoning + Flow**

---

## 9. Types of AI Agents (High Level)

* Reactive agents
* Tool-using agents
* Planning agents
* Autonomous agents

(Detailed types are covered in later sections.)

---

## 10. Exam / Interview Key Points

✔ AI agent can reason and act autonomously
✔ Uses tools and APIs
✔ Follows Think → Act → Observe loop
✔ More powerful than simple AI models
✔ Core building block of modern AI apps

### ✅ Section 2.2 Completed

This concept is **fundamental** for understanding **LangChain agents and modern AI systems**.
