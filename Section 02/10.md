# 10: Where LangGraph Fits in the AI Stack

This section explains **where LangGraph fits** in the **modern AI application stack**, especially in relation to **LangChain, agents, and orchestration**.

---

## 1. What is LangGraph?

**LangGraph** is a framework built on top of **LangChain** for creating **stateful, multi-step, agent-based workflows** using **graphs**.

📌 **Simple definition:**

> LangGraph is used to design and manage complex AI agent flows with memory, state, and loops.

---

## 2. Why LangGraph Was Introduced

Traditional LangChain agents:

* Are hard to control
* Have limited visibility into steps
* Are difficult to pause, resume, or debug

LangGraph solves this by:

* Making agent flows explicit
* Supporting loops and branches
* Maintaining shared state
* Enabling long-running agents

## 3. Modern AI Stack (Updated View)

   └─ LangGraph (Agent Flow & State)

```

📌 LangGraph sits **inside the orchestration layer**, alongside LangChain.

## 4. LangGraph vs LangChain (Position-wise)

| Aspect           | LangChain             | LangGraph               |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Purpose          | Build chains & agents | Control agent flow      |
| Flow type        | Linear / implicit     | Graph-based / explicit  |
| State handling   | Limited               | Strong state management |
| Loops & branches | Hard                  | Native support          |

---

## 5. What LangGraph Controls

LangGraph manages:

* Agent execution order
* Decision branching
* Retry logic
* Cycles (loops)
* Shared state between steps

📌 It gives **fine-grained control** over agent behavior.

---

## 6. How LangChain and LangGraph Work Together

LangChain:

* Provides LLMs
* Provides tools
* Provides agents

LangGraph:

* Organizes agents into graphs
* Controls execution flow
* Maintains state

📌 **Think of LangChain as the tools, LangGraph as the controller.**

---

## 7. Example: Agent Flow Without vs With LangGraph

### Without LangGraph

* Agent decides steps internally
* Limited observability
* Hard to debug

### With LangGraph

* Steps are nodes
* Decisions are edges
* Flow is visible and controllable

---

## 8. Real-World Use Case

### AI Research Agent

Flow:

1. Accept query
2. Search web
3. Analyze results
4. Decide if more search needed
5. Generate final answer

📌 This loop and branching logic is **ideal for LangGraph**.

---

## 9. When to Use LangGraph

Use LangGraph when:

* Agent logic is complex
* You need retries or loops
* State must be preserved
* Multiple agents interact

---

## 10. When LangGraph Is NOT Needed

LangGraph is not required when:

* Tasks are simple
* Linear chains are enough
* No looping or branching logic

---

## 11. LangGraph vs Other Orchestration Tools

| Tool      | Focus              |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| LangChain | LLM integration    |
| LangGraph | Agent flow & state |
| Airflow   | Data pipelines     |
| Temporal  | General workflows  |

---

## 12. Exam / Interview Key Points

✔ LangGraph sits in orchestration layer
✔ Built on top of LangChain
✔ Manages stateful agent workflows
✔ Supports loops, branches, retries
✔ Used for complex, long-running agents

### ✅ Section 2.5 Completed

LangGraph is essential for **production-grade AI agents** with controlled behavior.
