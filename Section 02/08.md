# 08: Chains vs Agents

This section explains the **difference between Chains and Agents**, a very important concept in **LangChain, AI agents, exams, and interviews**.

---

## 1. What is a Chain?

A **Chain** is a **fixed, predefined sequence of steps** where:

* Input goes through a set order
* Each step executes exactly as designed
* No decision-making happens during execution

📌 **Simple definition:**

> A Chain is a predictable workflow where steps run in a fixed order.

---

## 2. What is an Agent?

An **Agent** is a **dynamic decision-making system** that:

* Thinks before acting
* Chooses tools dynamically
* Decides next steps based on results

📌 **Simple definition:**

> An Agent is an intelligent system that can decide *what to do next* to achieve a goal.

## 3. Key Difference: Fixed vs Dynamic

| Aspect          | Chain      | Agent             |
| --------------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| Flow            | Fixed      | Dynamic           |
| Decision-making | ❌ No       | ✅ Yes             |
| Tool usage      | Predefined | Chosen at runtime |
| Flexibility     | Low        | High              |
| Predictability  | High       | Medium            |

## 4. How a Chain Works

### Chain Execution Flow

```
Input
 ↓
Step 1
 ↓
Step 2
 ↓
Step 3
 ↓
Output
```

📌 Every step is known in advance.

---

### Example: Chain

Task: "Translate English to French"

Steps:

1. Prompt template
2. LLM call
3. Output

This is best handled by a **chain**.

---

## 5. How an Agent Works

### Agent Execution Flow

```
Goal
 ↓
Think
 ↓
Choose Action
 ↓
Use Tool
 ↓
Observe Result
 ↓
Decide Next Step
 ↓
Final Output
```

📌 The path may change during execution.

---

### Example: Agent

Task: "Find best laptop under ₹60,000"

Possible actions:

* Search products
* Compare prices
* Check reviews
* Summarize results

An **agent** decides which action to take.

## 6. Chains vs Agents (Detailed Comparison)

| Feature         | Chain        | Agent                     |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------------------------- |
| Execution order | Predefined   | Adaptive                  |
| Reasoning       | Minimal      | Strong reasoning          |
| Tool selection  | Hard-coded   | Dynamic                   |
| Error handling  | Limited      | Can retry/change approach |
| Best for        | Simple tasks | Complex tasks             |

## 7. When to Use a Chain

Use **Chains** when:

* Steps are simple and fixed
* Task is predictable
* No decision-making is required

Examples:

* Text summarization
* Translation
* Formatting data

---

## 8. When to Use an Agent

Use **Agents** when:

* Task is complex
* Requires multiple tools
* Steps cannot be predefined

Examples:

* Research assistant
* Customer support bot
* Autonomous AI systems

---

## 9. Chains and Agents in LangChain

### LangChain Chains

* LLMChain
* SequentialChain
* RouterChain

### LangChain Agents

* ReAct Agent
* Tool-calling Agent
* Plan-and-Execute Agent

---

## 10. Real-World Analogy

* **Chain** → Recipe (fixed steps)
* **Agent** → Chef (decides actions based on situation)

---

## 11. Exam / Interview Key Points

✔ Chains follow fixed steps
✔ Agents make decisions dynamically
✔ Chains are simple and predictable
✔ Agents are flexible and powerful
✔ Agents use Think → Act → Observe loop

This distinction is **critical** for understanding **modern AI agent systems**.
